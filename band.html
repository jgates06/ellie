		<h1><strong><center>Big Bad Voodoo Daddy</center></strong></h1>
		<p><font size="4">Big Bad Voodoo Daddy is one of my all-time favorite bands because no matter how many times 
		I have heard the same song by them, it never fails to put a smile on my face and set my fingers tapping to their
		outrageous swinging beats and fun lyrics. Voodoo Daddy has been playing together since the early 90â€™s and have
		not only put out 8 albums, they have made many appearances on tv, the big screen and performed before countless 
		live audiences the world over.  Their style of retro-swing is guaranteed to get your pulse pounding with their 
		version of Big-band Dance and lounge music.</font>
