    <td>This park is located at 1251 SE Ranson Rd, Lee's Summit, MO 64063 run under the water tower. This park features tunnels, balance beam and an obstacle course in the section for medium to large dogs.   There is a paved walking trail, plenty of benches and has a kids play ground right outside the off leash run area.  There are bathrooms on site and running water for people and dogs alike.  All in all, this is our favorite of the two due to the large area and ease of access.<p><a href="https://cityofls.net/Parks/Parks-Shelters-Trails/Parks/Happy-Tails-Park" target="_blank">More Information</li>  </td>
